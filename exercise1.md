Let us assume that the application is coded in Python. In a CI setup, the linting can be done using two packages: flake8 and black. Flake8 first helps us to find style errors. These errors are then fixed via black according to the PEP8 standard. Secondly, the tools required to test the Python application is pytest and codecov. Both are ver easy-to-use testing libraries for Python projects and can also help keep track of the percentage of lines that are tested. The developed project can then be packaged using the Packaging Python software. Finally, the Python package can then be built and uploaded to PyPI for a new release.

For other alternatives to cloud-based setups, CircleCI is another popular alternative to GitHub Actions. Some advantages of using CircleCI over GitHub Actions are its ability to work with both private or public repositories and also the ability to configure more than one workflow. Contrastingly, Travis-CI can be used as an alternative to Jenkins given that it is also a self-hosted setup that works with Python. Travis-CI takes lesser time to get started with lesser customization options compared to Jenkins.

Since this is a medium software project with only 6 developers, they can use a cloud-based solution as they can focus more on the development of the application and not have to worry about setting up their own CI system. This decision can be further justified by looking at other information such as the requirements of this project such as graphics card or security requirements. Not only that, the budget of the project should also be taken into consideration as a self-hosted setup may be more expensive.
